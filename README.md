# 🐾 Paw Jump

**Paw Jump** is a 2D endless runner game inspired by the classic Dino Chrome game. The main goal is to avoid obstacles, collect items, and achieve the highest possible score.

## 🎮 Gameplay

In **Paw Jump**, the player controls a character that automatically runs forward. The player must:

- **Avoid obstacles** by jumping or ducking.
- **Collect items** to increase score and level up.
- **Survive as long as possible** without losing all lives.

## 🚀 Leveling System

- The game increases in difficulty every **250 meters**, advancing the player to the next level.
- **Speed increases** by `0.2x` of the previous level's speed.
- To level up, players must collect at least **15 fish** (required item) before reaching the next level checkpoint.
- Failing to collect enough fish results in a **game over**.

## 🧱 Obstacles

Each level introduces more challenging combinations:

- **Level 1**: Ground-level sunflowers.
- **Level 2**: Sunflowers + flying birds.
- **Level 3**: Sunflowers + flying birds + moving clouds (vertical motion).
- **Level 4 and above**: Random combinations of the above.

## ❤️ Lives System

- The character starts with **4 lives**.
- Hitting an obstacle reduces the character’s lives by 1.
- The game ends when all lives are lost.

## 🔮 Buff Items

There are two types of buff items in the game:

1. **Meat**
   - Enlarges the character.
   - Temporarily slows down the game speed for **3 seconds**.
2. **Supplement**
   - Grants **immunity to 1 obstacle hit** for the next level.
   - Slightly darkens the map for the level's duration.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Arrow Up (↑)**: Jump.
- **Arrow Down (↓)**: Fast drop.

## 🏠 User Interface

- On launch, the player lands on the **Home screen**.
- Tap the **Play** button to start the game.
- Upon losing (either due to running out of lives or not collecting enough fish), players can:
  - **Retry** the game.
  - **Exit** the application.

## 🏁 Objective

- Dodge obstacles.
- Collect items.
- Reach new levels.
- Beat your **high score**!
